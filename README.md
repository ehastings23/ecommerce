**Contribution and Credit**
- Thounny Keo: Very helpful in the validation phase and website background code setup.
- Jalen Battle: Suggested use of the checkout page bootstrap.
- Kevin Long (Instructor): Very helpful and patient with students throughout the entire Capstone. Increased my understanding of code overall.
- LC3 Cache Money Front End Development Class: The entirety of our class worked together and cooperated throughout this project, never leaving one of each other behind.

**My Point of View**
- In the beginning of this project I had little understanding of the coding process.
- I lacked in knowledge of specified tags and formats as well as file structure.
- As I progressed with the capstone I got more comfortable with VSCode, implementing bootstrap, and learning connecting tags between HTML and CSS.
- Overall it was a great learning experience I started off a little rocky but overtime i learned essetial skills and I look forward to learning more.
